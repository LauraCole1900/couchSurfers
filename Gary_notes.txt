Handlebars Way:

  1. The browser requests a page, and in the url is the info specific to that page
  2. Your route receives that request, and uses thar url information to query the database
  3. When you get the data back, you need to build a page with that data (using handlebars)
  4. When handlebars is done, the finished page goes to the browser



JQuery (Ajax) Way:

1. The browser requests a page 
2. You send down a handlebars page, but the data query is run with jQuery
3. When the page hits the browser, jQuery will make  an ajax call to get the data for that page 
4. That call hits your API route, and your api route sends the data to jQuery, jQuery populates the DOM
